METHOD
	SIMULATION
		The two provided systems (contained in cold.dat and hot.dat) were evolved over 2*10^5 timesteps.
		This was done using the code which can be found in the SOURCE folders.
	ANALYSIS
		TEMPERATURE
		Using the graphical representation of the Temperature (Temperature.png) it was decided that the Systems reached equlibrium
		after 10^5 timesteps. To get the average temperature the date from timestep 10^5 to 2*10^5 were used.
		The average temperature was calculated for each system individually as well as for both systems together.
		In addition the standart deviation was also calculated.
		ENERGY
		The fluctuation of the Energy was first verified to be small in task 2, using 1000 timesteps. This controll yielded fluctuations
		in the energy of max 0.1 eV. 
		The energy was also logged in the simulation over 2*10^5 timesteps. the picture "Energy-fluctuations.png" shows that the fluctuations
		usually stay smaller than 0.08 eV.
	RESULTS
		Results are stored in the file RESULT.txt. In addition the raw data produced by the simulation can be found in the OUTPUT folders.
